# spaceship
So I never did the typical "I'm a newbie programmer so let's build a game" thing when I first started to code. However, I was recently playing around with JS animations and felt inspired to reconstruct a classic pixel filled spaceship game from my childhood!

This project is currently a WIP, but you can view it here: https://the-one-and-only-h.github.io/spaceship/index.html
